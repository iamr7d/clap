# Smart Clap-Controlled 10x10 LED Matrix

## Overview
This project implements a sound-responsive 10x10 LED matrix display that reacts to clapping or other sound inputs. The system uses an Arduino to control the LED matrix and includes Python applications for additional functionality.

## Features
- Sound detection and response using a microphone sensor
- 10x10 LED matrix for visual feedback
- Multiple display patterns and animations
- Configurable sensitivity and response modes

## Hardware Components
- Arduino (Uno/Nano/Mega)
- 10x10 LED Matrix
- Sound sensor/microphone module
- Jumper wires
- Power supply

## Software
- Arduino sketch for LED matrix control
- Python applications for extended functionality:
  - `1APP.py`: initial try
  - `2APP.py`: better one

## Installation
1. Connect the hardware components according to the circuit diagram
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to your board
3. Install required Python dependencies (if using the Python applications)
4. Run the desired application

## Usage
1. Power on the system
2. Clap or make a sound to trigger the LED matrix
3. Different sound patterns can trigger different display modes

## Future Enhancements
- Bluetooth connectivity
- Mobile app control
- Additional animation patterns
- Voice command recognition
